# Minimal Blog Card

> I created a Beginner level challenge from [devChallenges.com](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard). The Minimal Blog Card is a simple web component created using HTML and CSS. The challenge involved replicating a provided image while treating the task as if I were implementing a designer's work.
